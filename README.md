# mb'midiCV

in development ! Check later...

System software for my MIDI to CV interface, which can be found there: ADD LINK.

To keep a bit of cleanyness, I split the code into the main ino and some potential
lib files (.h + .cpp).
The latter could also be used as a stand alone lib when put into your Arduino
library folder.

How it works

### Used Libraries
- Timer
- MIDI
- MidiUSB
- encoder


Display:
Extra thing, somewhat optional or replaceable by DOGM or similar SPI based displays.
